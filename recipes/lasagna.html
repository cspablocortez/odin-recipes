    <img src="https://www.cookingclassy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lasagna15.jpg" alt="Image of Lasagna Dish" width="300px">
    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking.</p>
